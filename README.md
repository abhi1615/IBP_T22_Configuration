# IBP_T22_Configuration
Planning Area T22 configuration 
The Planning Area ID: T22 (It is crucial to use the exact same ID if possible when restoring, or at least remember what the original was).

The Time Profile: Note the "Time Profile ID" you used (visible in the General tab of the Planning Area). If you try to restore the binary file into a system that has a conflicting Time Profile, knowing your original settings helps debug.

Key Planning Levels: Just list your main 2-3 levels (e.g., MTHPRODLOC, WKPRODCUST). This helps jog your memory on how the model was aggregated.
